Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I am Anzul Aqeel, a skilled full stack developer with over 10 years of experience in developing and managing large-scale projects across various sectors. This repository showcases some of my key projects and the technologies I have expertise in.

## About Me

I have a diverse range of skills in full stack development, including expertise in PHP, MERN, MySQL, Laravel, Flutter, Node.js, and Express.js. Over the past decade, I have dedicated my time and effort to starting and successfully managing several businesses, including:

- **Al Ghani Network**
